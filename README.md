# Jonah Jacobsen's Final Project
For my project I am going to work alone. I intend to make the code behind an iPod. The user will be able to have a bunch of songs, create playlists, add/remove songs, search for songs, and even play songs in a shuffle ("random" order). The bare bones project will just compose of having the songs title, artist, album, and length as data values. I also hope to be able to give the user the option to play mp3 files from within the program.

DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT MAKE ANY OF THE MUSIC IN THIS PROJECT

How to Run: download the text file, the cpp files, and the mp3 files to a folder on your computer. Open terminal and cd to the directory you saved the files in. Compile by typing "g++ -std=c++11 _____________". Execute by typing "./a.out". From here you will...

System Requirements: Linux, probably OS X, and maybe Windows. For full functionality speakers would be advised.
