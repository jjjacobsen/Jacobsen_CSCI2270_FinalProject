# Jonah Jacobsen's Final Project
For my project I am going to work alone. I intend to make the code behind an iPod. The user will be able to have a bunch of songs, create playlists, add/remove songs, search for songs, and even play songs in a shuffle ("random" order). The bare bones project will just compose of having the songs title, artist, album, and length as data values. If I can figure it out I will also implement the ability to play an mp3 file from within the program.

System Requirements: Space on HDD to store mp3 files\n
